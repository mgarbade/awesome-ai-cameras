# AI-Enhanced Cameras: Dedicated Hardware for On-Device Vision Processing

Welcome to a dedicated space for exploring and cataloging cameras equipped with hardware-based neural networks. These devices integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly onto hardware, paired with a camera sensor, facilitating high-speed image processing with minimal power consumption and no need for extensive external data transmission.

## Why Hardware-Based AI Cameras?
Integrating AI directly into camera hardware allows for:
- **High Frame Rates & Low Bandwidth**: Streamline data processing directly on the device, reducing the need for data transfer.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Ideal for battery-operated or remote devices.
- **No Communication Overhead**: Operates independently of network constraints.
- **Simplified Deployment**: No advanced programming required, making it accessible for various applications.
